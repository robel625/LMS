       passage: " Friendship is something that everyone needs in life, regardless of age, background, or achievements. It can be defined as a relationship between two or more people who care about one another and share similarities. People often make bonds with those they share common interests with, or those they view as being friends. Despite the many kinds of friendship out there - some temporary, some lifelong - it always involves loyalty and trust." +
" The type of friendship varies depending on the situation. For some, a friendship formed in childhood may last until adulthood Others might have numerous friends of different ages, some an entire life and others just a few months old while still maintaining the same level of closeness with all of them. Professional connections can also be considered friendships if those involved remain loyal to each other and trust each other's judgment." +
" Spending time together is important for any kind of relationship to thrive - that includes friendships too! Having conversations helps build your bond with someone as you reach greater understanding through shared experiences, values, needs, worries, dreams and visions for the future. Simple activities like playing games together, watching movies or going shopping make time spent together even more meaningful by creating lasting moments you love to look back on fondly." +
" Having meaningful friendships doesn't only bring color and purpose into our lives; it also helps us become better versions of ourselves. Your friends can inspire you to do great things in life and provide unconditional support when you need it most during tough times. Ultimately, no matter what stage your friendship is in whether brand new or lifelong- it provides a kind of safety net that should never be taken for granted!" +
